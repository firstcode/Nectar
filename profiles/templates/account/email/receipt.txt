Dear {{ guardianFirstname|default_if_none:"Guardian / Parent" }},

I'm {{ internalName }} from First Code and Iâ€™d like to personally welcome you and your child, {{studentFirstname}}, to our academy. The class will start soon and we are very excited to see {{studentFirstname}}!

We believe that coding can empower us to become creators and not just consumers of technology. It means a lot to us to have the opportunity to be part of this journey with your child.
