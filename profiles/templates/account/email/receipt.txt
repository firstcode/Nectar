Dear {{ guardianFirstname|default_if_none:"Guardian / Parent" }},

I'm {{ internalName }} from First Code and I’d like to personally welcome you and your child, {{studentFirstname}}, to our academy. The class will start soon and we are very excited to see {{studentFirstname}} for the new term!

We believe that coding can empower us to become creators and not just consumers of technology. It means a lot to us to have the opportunity to be part of this journey with your child.


We have received your child’s information below:

Day(s): {{dateStr}}

Check our calendar for useful information about your schedule, what to bring to the class, what to do if you miss a class, how to find us etc.

Meanwhile, feel free to reach out to me via email or at {{ officePhone }} if you have any questions. We will see you and {{studentFirstname}} on 1st day of class on {{firstDate}}!
